# Year1-Semester2-Programming
My collection of Java Programming assignments from Semester 2 of Software Systems Development in W.I.T

Scout V1 -  Simple Scout System which allows the user to create a scout object and update, list, remove and save/load those objects using ArrayLists.
Scout2 - More complex Scout System which uses inheritence and interface classes.

These programs were developed using IntelliJ.
